# War_Card_Game

This program is meant to recreate the card game WAR. If you never heard of the game watch this video that explains how the game works: https://youtu.be/yX-jOVer758  

The game in person is a great kids game even though there is barely any actually actions to do besides for flipping over the top card on your deck. That motion alone and the action of holding the deck are enough of a stimulus for kids to play.  
However to play this game on a computer with no UI is very lame! All you would do is hit a single key on your keyboard to see the next card.  

To create a better user experiance a new rule was set in place!  
1 - The user is allowed to choose his card every other hand that is dealt.  

This seems dumb as why wouldnt someone just choose the best card everytime!?

2 - Which ever card you choose during your hand goes to the computer in the next hand!!

Do you see how this works?!  

Example:
ROUND 1: User chooses a card - lets choose a JACK, Computer gets a randomly generated card.
ROUND 2: User gets a randomly generated card, Computer gets the JACK!  

Using this logic the User needs to be careful on which card he chooses becasue in the next hand the Computer will get that same card! 
So ask yourself DO YOU FEEL LUCKY!?

Enjoy the game!
